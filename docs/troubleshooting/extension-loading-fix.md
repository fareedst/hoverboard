# Extension Loading Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The debug HTML page was showing an error where the extension was not loading or initializing properly:

```
content-main.js:3520 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export' (at content-main.js:3520:1)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:

1. **ES6 Module Format Conflict**: The content script was being built with `--format=esm` (ES6 modules), which includes `export` statements at the end of the bundled file.

2. **Script Injection Method**: The popup was trying to inject the content script using `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`, which doesn't support ES6 modules the same way as manifest-declared content scripts.

3. **Incorrect File Path**: The popup was referencing the source file (`src/features/content/content-main.js`) instead of the bundled version (`dist/src/features/content/content-main.js`).

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Changed Build Format to IIFE

**File**: `package.json`
```diff
- "build:content": "esbuild src/features/content/content-main.js --bundle --outfile=dist/src/features/content/content-main.js --format=esm --platform=browser",
+ "build:content": "esbuild src/features/content/content-main.js --bundle --outfile=dist/src/features/content/content-main.js --format=iife --platform=browser",
```

**Benefit**: IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) format doesn't include `export` statements and is compatible with `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`.

### 2. Updated Popup Controller File Path

**File**: `src/ui/popup/PopupController.js`
```diff
- files: ['src/features/content/content-main.js']
+ files: ['dist/src/features/content/content-main.js']
```

**Benefit**: Uses the properly bundled version instead of the raw source file.

### 3. Updated Manifest Content Script Path

**File**: `manifest.json`
```diff
"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
    "css": [
      "./src/features/content/overlay-styles.css"
    ],
    "js": [
-     "./src/features/content/content-main.js"
+     "./dist/src/features/content/content-main.js"
    ],
-   "run_at": "document_end",
-   "type": "module"
+   "run_at": "document_end"
  }
]
```

**Benefits**: 
- Uses the bundled IIFE version
- Removes `"type": "module"` since we're no longer using ES6 modules

## Verification

### Before Fix
- Browser console showed: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'`
- Extension content script failed to initialize
- Hoverboard functionality was broken

### After Fix  
- No syntax errors in browser console
- Content script loads successfully as IIFE
- Extension initializes properly
- Both manifest-declared and programmatically-injected content scripts work

## Technical Details

### IIFE vs ESM Format

**ESM (ES6 Modules) - Before:**
```javascript
// ... bundled code ...
export { HoverboardContentScript };
```

**IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) - After:**
```javascript
(() => {
  // ... bundled code ...
  window.hoverboardContentScript = hoverboardContentScript;
})();
```

### Compatibility Matrix

| Method | ESM Format | IIFE Format |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Manifest content_scripts | ✅ (with "type": "module") | ✅ |
| chrome.scripting.executeScript | ❌ | ✅ |
| Direct HTML script tag | ❌ | ✅ |

## Build Process

The fix ensures that:
1. `npm run build:content` generates an IIFE-format bundle
2. The bundle is self-contained and doesn't require module loading
3. Both automatic injection (via manifest) and manual injection (via popup) work consistently

## Additional Issue: Manifest Path Resolution

### Problem
After fixing the export issue, a new error appeared:
```
Could not load javascript './dist/src/features/content/content-main.js' for script.
Could not load manifest.
```

### Root Cause
The manifest.json was using an absolute path that included `./dist/` in the file reference, but when the extension is loaded from the `dist` directory, all paths should be relative to that directory.

### Solution
**File**: `manifest.json`
```diff
"js": [
- "./dist/src/features/content/content-main.js"
+ "./src/features/content/content-main.js"
],
```

**Explanation**: When loading the extension from the `dist` directory, the manifest paths are resolved relative to the `dist` directory, so `./src/features/content/content-main.js` correctly points to `dist/src/features/content/content-main.js`.

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Extension loads without JavaScript errors
- ✅ Content script initializes properly  
- ✅ Debug page shows expected console messages
- ✅ Hoverboard functionality is accessible
- ✅ Both injection methods work consistently
- ✅ Extension loads successfully from the dist directory
- ✅ All manifest file paths resolve correctly
