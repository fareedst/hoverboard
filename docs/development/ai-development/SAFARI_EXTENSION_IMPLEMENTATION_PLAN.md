# Safari Extension Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - Enhanced Safari Error Handling Framework  
**Semantic Tokens:** `SAFARI-EXT-IMPL-001`, `SAFARI-EXT-API-001`, `SAFARI-EXT-TEST-001`, `SAFARI-EXT-ERROR-001`

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for Safari browser extension support in the Hoverboard project. All implementation decisions are coordinated with existing architecture documents and use semantic tokens for complete cross-referencing.

**Current Status:** The Chrome extension has evolved significantly since the original Safari plan was documented. This document has been updated to reflect the current Manifest V3 implementation and prioritize changes that can be executed while the extension is still only a Chrome extension.

**Latest Update:** [2025-07-20] Safari App Extension Integration (`SAFARI-EXT-IMPL-001`) has been successfully implemented with comprehensive Safari extension packaging, deployment pipeline, and App Store preparation capabilities.
