# Safari Extension Implementation Plan - Service Worker Integration

## Overview
This document records the step-by-step implementation of service worker integration for the Chrome extension, which is a prerequisite for Safari compatibility. The plan was designed to avoid dead-ends by testing smaller, verifiable steps.

## Implementation Steps Completed

### Step 1: Minimal Service Worker File ✅
**Action:** Created a barebones `service-worker.js` with only a console log.
**File:** `src/core/service-worker.js`
```javascript
console.log('Service worker loaded');
```
**Test:** Verified service worker loads and logs appear in Chrome Extensions page.
**Result:** ✅ Working

### Step 2: Manifest Configuration ✅
**Action:** Updated `manifest.json` to use correct service worker path.
**Changes:**
- Changed `"service_worker": "./src/core/service-worker.js"` to `"service_worker": "src/core/service-worker.js"`
- Maintained `"type": "module"`
**Test:** Verified service worker recognized in Extensions page.
**Result:** ✅ Working

### Step 3: Basic Event Handling ✅
**Action:** Added `chrome.runtime.onInstalled` event listener.
**Code Added:**
```javascript
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  console.log('Service worker: onInstalled event fired');
});
```
**Test:** Verified event fires on extension reload/update.
**Result:** ✅ Working

### Step 4: API Access Verification ✅
**Action:** Added `chrome.tabs.query` API call to verify permissions.
**Code Added:**
```javascript
chrome.tabs.query({}, (tabs) => {
  console.log('Service worker: Number of open tabs:', tabs.length);
});
```
**Test:** Verified API call works and logs tab count.
**Result:** ✅ Working

### Step 5: Message Passing ✅
**Action:** Added message listener for test communication.
**Code Added:**
```javascript
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message === 'test-message') {
    console.log('Service worker: Received test-message');
    sendResponse({ reply: 'Service worker received your message!' });
  }
});
```
**Test:** Verified message passing works between service worker and other extension parts.
**Result:** ✅ Working

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Response Structure Correction
**Problem:** Message handler was returning bookmark data directly instead of wrapped in success response structure.
**Solution:** Updated `src/core/message-handler.js` to return `{success: true, data: bookmark}` instead of just `bookmark`.
**Impact:** Fixed overlay and popup data display.

### Fix 2: Content Script Data Extraction
**Problem:** Content script was setting `this.currentBookmark = response.data` but response was double-wrapped.
**Solution:** Changed to `this.currentBookmark = response.data.data` to extract actual bookmark data.
**Impact:** Fixed overlay data display.

### Fix 3: Popup Data Extraction
**Problem:** Popup was extracting `response.data` but response was double-wrapped.
**Solution:** Changed to `resolve(response.data.data)` in `getBookmarkData` method.
**Impact:** Fixed popup data display.

### Fix 4: Restricted URL Handling
**Problem:** Extension tried to show overlay on restricted pages like `chrome://newtab/`.
**Solution:** Updated `handleShowHoverboard` in `PopupController.js` to show user-friendly error message instead of throwing error.
**Code:**
```javascript
if (!this.canInjectIntoTab(this.currentTab)) {
  this.uiManager.showError('Hoverboard is not available on this page (e.g., Chrome Web Store, New Tab, or Settings).');
  return;
}
```
**Impact:** Better user experience on restricted pages.

## Current Status
- ✅ Service worker loads successfully
- ✅ Event handling works
- ✅ API access verified
- ✅ Message passing functional
- ✅ Overlay displays live bookmark data
- ✅ Popup displays live bookmark data
- ✅ Restricted page handling implemented

## Next Steps for Safari Compatibility
1. Test service worker in Safari Web Extension Converter
2. Identify Safari-specific API differences
3. Implement browser detection and polyfills as needed
4. Test cross-browser functionality
