**Semantic Token:** [SAFARI-EXT-001]
**Date:** 2025-07-15

---

## Overview
This plan details the steps to implement and test the Safari version of the Hoverboard extension. All steps are cross-referenced with existing architecture and specification documents and use the [SAFARI-EXT-001] semantic token family for traceability.

---

## 1. Code Preparation
- [ ] Audit all `chrome.*` API usage and replace with `browser.*` or polyfill ([SAFARI-EXT-SHIM-001]).
- [ ] Add platform abstraction layer ([SAFARI-EXT-SHIM-001]).
- [ ] Update manifest for Safari compatibility ([SAFARI-EXT-MANIFEST-001]).

## 2. UI and CSS
- [ ] Test all overlays, popups, and options pages in Safari ([SAFARI-EXT-UI-001]).
- [ ] Fix any CSS or font issues specific to Safari ([SAFARI-EXT-UI-001]).

## 3. Feature Testing
- [ ] Run all unit and integration tests in Safari ([SAFARI-EXT-TEST-001]).
- [ ] Add Safari-specific test cases for popup sizing, permissions, and storage ([SAFARI-EXT-TEST-001]).
- [ ] Manual QA for all user flows ([SAFARI-EXT-TEST-001]).

## 4. Accessibility and Performance
- [ ] Validate VoiceOver and keyboard navigation ([SAFARI-EXT-TEST-001]).
- [ ] Profile performance and memory usage in Safari ([SAFARI-EXT-TEST-001]).

## 5. Distribution
- [ ] Create Xcode project for Safari extension ([SAFARI-EXT-DIST-001]).
- [ ] Package, sign, and submit to the Mac App Store ([SAFARI-EXT-DIST-001]).

## 6. Coordination with Existing Architecture
- All steps here are cross-referenced with:
  - [DARK_THEME_DEFAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md]
  - [TOGGLE_SYNCHRONIZATION_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md]
  - [TAG_SYNCHRONIZATION_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md]
  - [OVERLAY_THEMING_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md]
  - [AI-FIRST-001] and [feature-tracking-matrix.md]
- Any improvements or platform-specific changes must be reflected in these documents as needed.
