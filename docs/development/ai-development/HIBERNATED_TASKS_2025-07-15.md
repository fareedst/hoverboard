# Hibernated Tasks - 2025-07-15

**Date**: 2025-07-15  
**Status**: Hibernated for Later Restoration  
**Purpose**: Track unfinished tasks that are not currently being worked on but may need to be restored if encountered

---

## 🎯 Hibernation Policy

Tasks are placed in hibernation when:
- They are not currently blocking development progress
- They have comprehensive documentation for later restoration
- They may be encountered again in future development cycles
- They have clear success criteria and implementation plans

Tasks can be restored from hibernation when:
- They become blocking issues
- They are encountered during development
- They are requested for implementation
- They become high priority

## 🔄 Hibernation Management

### **Status Tracking**
- **🛌 Hibernated**: Task is preserved but not actively worked on
- **🔄 In Progress**: Task has been restored and is being worked on
- **✅ Completed**: Task has been completed and removed from hibernation
- **❌ Cancelled**: Task has been cancelled and will not be restored

### **Documentation Requirements**
All hibernated tasks must have:
- Complete implementation plan
- Clear success criteria
- Restoration triggers defined
- Restoration process documented
- Cross-references to related documentation

### **Review Schedule**
- **Monthly**: Review hibernated tasks for relevance
- **Quarterly**: Assess if hibernated tasks should be cancelled
- **On Demand**: Restore tasks when triggers are encountered
