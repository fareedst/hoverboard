### 5. Architectural Alignment
- All decisions are coordinated with existing architecture documents, including:
  - `DARK_THEME_DEFAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `OVERLAY_THEMING_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`
  - `TAG_SYNCHRONIZATION_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md`
- Improvements or changes are reflected in these documents as needed.
