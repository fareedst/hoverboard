# TOGGLE_SYNCHRONIZATION_SPECIFICATION.md

## Toggle Synchronization Feature Specification

**Date:** 2025-07-14  
**Semantic Tokens:** [TOGGLE_SYNC_SPEC], [TOGGLE_SYNC_ACTION], [TOGGLE_SYNC_POPUP], [TOGGLE_SYNC_OVERLAY], [TOGGLE_SYNC_SITE_RECORD], [TOGGLE_SYNC_MESSAGE]

---

### 1. Purpose
This document specifies the requirements and constraints for synchronizing toggle button states between the popup and overlay windows. It ensures that toggling in one interface is immediately reflected in the other and that the site record is updated accordingly.  
**[TOGGLE_SYNC_SPEC]**

---

### 2. Requirements
- Clicking a toggle button in the popup window must:
  - Update the toggle display in the popup window (**already implemented**)  
    **[TOGGLE_SYNC_POPUP]**
  - Update the toggle display in the overlay window (**new feature**)  
    **[TOGGLE_SYNC_OVERLAY]**
  - Update the site record for the toggle state (**fix required**)  
    **[TOGGLE_SYNC_SITE_RECORD]**
- All communication between popup and overlay must use a robust message protocol.  
  **[TOGGLE_SYNC_MESSAGE]**
- All code, tests, and documentation must reference the appropriate semantic tokens.  
  **[TOGGLE_SYNC_SPEC]**

---

### 3. Constraints
- The overlay and popup must not maintain independent state; synchronization must occur via a shared mechanism (e.g., background script or storage).  
  **[TOGGLE_SYNC_SITE_RECORD]**
- The solution must be robust to window reloads and extension reloads.  
  **[TOGGLE_SYNC_ARCH_DECISION]**
- All new and updated files must include semantic tokens for traceability.  
  **[TOGGLE_SYNC_SPEC]**
- The implementation must coordinate with and not duplicate existing state management or messaging patterns, as described in:
  - `DARK_THEME_DEFAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `OVERLAY_THEMING_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`
  - `TAG_SYNCHRONIZATION_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md`
  - Any other overlay, popup, or messaging-related docs

---

### 4. Cross-Referencing
- All related documents (implementation plan, architectural decisions, summary) must reference the semantic tokens defined in `TOGGLE_SYNCHRONIZATION_SEMANTIC_TOKENS.md`.
- Updates to tokens must be reflected in all cross-referenced files.

---

### 5. Out of Scope
- This specification does not address unrelated overlay or popup features.
- Only toggle synchronization and its direct dependencies are covered.

---

### 6. Compliance
- All code, tests, and documentation must be reviewed for compliance with this specification and semantic token usage.
