# Test Fix Architectural Decisions

**Date**: 2025-07-14  
**Status**: Architectural Decisions (Updated)  
**Version**: 1.1  
**Semantic Token**: `[TEST-FIX-ARCH-001]`

## 🏗️ Overview

This document captures all strategic and architectural decisions specific to the platform, language, and technology stack for implementing the test failure fixes. These decisions are immutable and form the foundation for all test infrastructure improvements.

## 🔄 Update Summary (2025-07-14)

- The tag sanitization logic is now a compromise solution: it preserves tag names and content, removes closing tags and attributes, and passes most test cases. However, some edge cases (nested/multiple tags, attributes, and XSS) still require further refinement for perfect compliance.
- The test-driven approach ensures that all changes are validated by comprehensive tests, and semantic tokens are used throughout for traceability and cross-referencing.
- Playwright tests are now separated from Jest, and the test infrastructure is enhanced.

- **ES Module Support in Jest:** Maintained.
- **Chrome API Mocking Strategy:** Maintained.

### JavaScript/ES6+ Language Decisions `[TEST-FIX-ARCH-001]`

## 🔒 Security Decisions

### Input Validation and Sanitization `[TEST-FIX-ARCH-001]`

- **Comprehensive Tag Sanitization Testing:**
  - The current implementation uses a regex-based approach to extract tag names and content, remove closing tags, and strip attributes. This passes most test cases but does not handle all complex HTML edge cases.
  - **Note:** For full compliance, consider using an HTML parser or more advanced logic to handle all edge cases, especially for XSS prevention and nested/multiple tags.

- **Mock External Dependencies:** Maintained.

- **Efficient Test Data Generation:** Maintained.
- **Test Isolation and Cleanup:** Maintained.

---

## 🔧 Technology Stack Decisions

- **Testing Framework Decisions:** Maintained.
- **Build and Configuration Decisions:** Maintained.

---

## 📋 Error Handling Decisions

- **Graceful Error Handling in Tests:** Maintained.
- **Comprehensive Error Mocking:** Maintained.

---

## 🔄 Integration Decisions

- **Modular Test Architecture:** Maintained.
- **Shared Test Utilities:** Maintained.

## 📝 Decision Summary (Updated)

- The tag sanitization logic is a compromise solution that passes most but not all edge cases. For full compliance, further refinement or an HTML parser may be needed.
- The test-driven approach and use of semantic tokens ensure traceability, maintainability, and alignment with specifications.
- All other architectural decisions remain as previously documented.
