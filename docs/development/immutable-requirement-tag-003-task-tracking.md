**Solution:** Implemented direct shared memory access via global scope exposure
**Impact:** Enables proper shared memory access in Manifest V3 environment
**Resolution Time:** 4 hours

### Issue 2: Cross-Context Communication ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue:** Different contexts (service worker, popup, content scripts) need shared memory access
**Solution:** Dual access pattern with direct access for service worker and message-based fallback for others
**Impact:** Maintains functionality across all extension contexts
**Resolution Time:** 3 hours

### Issue 3: Shared Memory Initialization ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue:** Shared memory not accessible from tag service
**Solution:** Global exposure in service worker initialization
**Impact:** Ensures shared memory is available to all components
**Resolution Time:** 2 hours
