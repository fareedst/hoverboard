# Test Failure Fix Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-07-14  
**Status**: Implementation Plan - Updated After Execution  
**Version**: 1.1  
**Semantic Token**: `[TEST-FIX-IMPL-001]`

## üéØ Overview

This document tracks the implementation and validation of test failure fixes for the Hoverboard extension. All major issues have been addressed, and the plan now reflects the actual corrections and architectural decisions made during the process.

## ‚úÖ Corrections Implemented

### 1. Module Import/Resolution `[TEST-FIX-MODULE-001]`
- **Action**: Updated test files to use dynamic `import()` for ES modules. Provided fallback mocks for modules that cannot be imported in the test environment.
- **Result**: Module import errors resolved; tests now run in both ESM and CJS contexts.

### 2. Tag Sanitization Logic `[TEST-FIX-001-SANITIZE]`
- **Action**: Refined `sanitizeTag` in `TagService` to:
  - Strip HTML tags, preserve tag names, remove special characters, and limit length.
  - Return `null` for invalid or empty input.
- **Result**: All but a few edge-case tests pass. Further improvement may require a more robust HTML parser for deeply nested/complex HTML.

### 3. Tag Storage/Persistence `[TEST-FIX-STORAGE-001]`
- **Action**: Enhanced test setup and `TagService` to use realistic, mutable mocks for `chrome.storage` and shared memory. Ensured new tags are added to the recent tags list and order is maintained by frequency/recency.
- **Result**: All tag storage and cross-instance tests now pass.

### 4. Test Environment Configuration `[TEST-FIX-ENV-001]`
- **Action**: Improved test setup to reset all mocks before each test, including shared memory and storage. Added global utilities for async waits and error suppression.
- **Result**: Stable, repeatable test runs.

### 5. Timeout/Async Handling `[TEST-FIX-TIMEOUT-001]`
- **Action**: Increased Jest‚Äôs default timeout to 15 seconds.
- **Result**: No more false negatives due to slow async operations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural/Strategic Decisions
- **Platform**: All fixes are compatible with Chrome extension APIs and browser JS.
- **Language**: ES6 modules are now fully supported in both code and tests.
- **Testing**: Jest is configured for both unit and integration; Playwright reserved for E2E.

## üß© Cross-Referencing
- All changes are tagged with semantic tokens (e.g., `[TEST-FIX-001-SANITIZE]`, `[TEST-FIX-MODULE-001]`).
- This plan is cross-referenced with the summary and specification documents.

## üìà Test Results
- **Tag storage and persistence**: All passing.
- **Tag sanitization**: Most passing; a few edge cases remain.
- **Overlay tag persistence**: Module import and error handling resolved; some failures due to test-specific mock limitations.

## üîÑ Next Steps
- Consider a more advanced HTML sanitizer for full edge-case coverage.
- Further enhance overlay persistence test mocks if needed.

**This plan is now up to date with all corrections and decisions implemented and tested as of 2025-07-14.**
