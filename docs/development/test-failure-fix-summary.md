# Test Failure Fix Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-14  
**Status**: Implementation Summary - Updated After Execution  
**Version**: 1.1  
**Semantic Token**: `[TEST-FIX-SUMMARY-001]`

## 🎯 Executive Summary

All major test failures have been addressed. The codebase now passes all tag storage and persistence tests, and most tag sanitization and overlay persistence tests. Remaining issues are limited to a few edge cases and test-specific mock limitations.

## 📊 Test Failure Analysis

### Issues Addressed `[TEST-FIX-SUMMARY-001]`

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Module Import/Resolution | Fixed | Dynamic import and fallback mocks implemented |
| Tag Sanitization Logic | Mostly Fixed | All but a few edge cases pass; further improvement possible |
| Tag Storage/Persistence | Fixed | All tests pass; realistic mocks and cache logic validated |
| Test Environment Config | Fixed | Stable, repeatable test runs |
| Timeout/Async Handling | Fixed | Increased Jest timeout prevents false negatives |

## 🏗️ Architectural/Strategic Decisions
- **Platform**: Chrome extension APIs and browser JS supported.
- **Language**: ES6 modules fully supported in code and tests.
- **Testing**: Jest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E.

## 🧩 Cross-Referencing
- Semantic tokens used throughout for traceability.
- This summary is cross-referenced with the implementation plan and specifications.

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Consider advanced HTML sanitizer for full edge-case coverage.
- Further enhance overlay persistence test mocks if needed.
