    INPUT: none (export); serialized config blob (import)
    OUTPUT: config object (export); void or error (import)
    DATA: settings, auth, inhibit URLs (from storage / to storage)

    exportConfig():
      PARALLEL_GET settings, auth, inhibitUrlList from storage (or config manager)
      BUILD config object = { settings, auth, inhibitUrls: inhibitUrlList }
      RETURN config object (serializable)

    importConfig(configBlob):
      PARSE configBlob
      VALIDATE structure
      WRITE settings to storage
      WRITE auth to storage
      WRITE inhibit URLs to storage (if present)
      HANDLE conflicts or overwrite per product rule
