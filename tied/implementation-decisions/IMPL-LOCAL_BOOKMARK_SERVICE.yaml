  problem: No implementation existed for storing bookmarks locally without the Pinboard API.
  related:
    - ARCH-LOCAL_STORAGE_PROVIDER (strategy and config)
    - ARCH-STORAGE (chrome.storage.local usage)
  solution: 'New class in `src/features/storage/local-bookmark-service.js` with methods: `getBookmarkForUrl`, `getRecentBookmarks`, `saveBookmark`, `deleteBookmark`, `saveTag`, `deleteTag`, `testConnection`, plus `trackBookmarkTags` and `extractTagsFromBookmarkData` for TagService integration. Return shapes match PinboardService (e.g. `{ success, code, message }` for save/delete; bookmark object with `url`, `description`, `extended`, `tags`, `time`, `shared`, `toread`, `hash`).'
  storage_key: '`hoverboard_local_bookmarks` (object: URL -> bookmark).'
  summary: '`LocalBookmarkService` implements the same bookmark provider contract as `PinboardService`, backed by `chrome.storage.local` under the key `hoverboard_local_bookmarks`. The default storage mode is local; Pinboard is selectable in Options. Bookmark records are stored as an object keyed by normalized URL for O(1) lookup; recent bookmarks are derived by sorting by `time` descending.'
  tag_integration: Constructor accepts optional `TagService`; same pattern as PinboardService for recent-tag tracking after save.
