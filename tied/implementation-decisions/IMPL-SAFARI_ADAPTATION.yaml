  rationale:
    why: Safari stability and performance
    problems_solved:
      - Safari memory issues
      - Messaging failures
    benefits:
      - Stable Safari support
      - Bounded recovery
  implementation_approach:
    summary: Safari shim, content optimizations, error handler with degraded mode
    details:
      - Platform detection
      - Safari config (timeouts, retries)
      - Animation/memory optimizations
      - Error handler with recovery
      - Degraded mode

    INPUT: platform (detect Safari); config (timeouts, retries); animation/content operations
    OUTPUT: Safari-specific config; optimized or fallback behavior; degraded mode on unrecoverable error
    DATA: getSafariConfig(); ErrorHandler with recovery

    ON init: IF Safari: config = getSafariConfig(); APPLY timeouts/retries

    optimizeSafariAnimations(): REDUCE or REPLACE heavy animations for Safari; BOUND memory

    ON error: ErrorHandler; TRY recovery; IF unrecoverable: ENTER degraded mode (minimal features)
