# [REQ-SIDE_PANEL_TAGS_TREE] Side panel tags and bookmarks tree
# Requirement: Chrome side panel shows hierarchical tree of tags (top level) and bookmarks (leaves);
# launched from popup; user selects tags and order; collapsible URL lists; click URL opens in new tab.

REQ-SIDE_PANEL_TAGS_TREE:
  name: Side Panel Tags and Bookmarks Tree
  category: Functional
  priority: P1
  status: Implemented
  rationale:
    why: Give users a dedicated side-panel view of bookmarks grouped by tag, without leaving the current window.
    problems_solved:
      - No at-a-glance tag-based browse of bookmarks in the extension
      - Opening full index page loses current tab context
    benefits:
      - Side panel stays open across tab changes; hierarchical tag → URLs view; user chooses which tags and order
      - Click URL opens in new tab; URL list per tag is collapsible
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: Side panel opens from popup (e.g. footer button "Tags tree" or "Side panel")
    - criterion: User can select one or more tags to display and control their order
    - criterion: Below tag selector, hierarchical display: tags at top level, URLs as leaf nodes showing bookmark name and URL
    - criterion: The list of URLs under each tag is collapsible
    - criterion: Clicking a URL opens it in a new tab
    - criterion: User can filter bookmarks by create time or update time (time range)
    - criterion: User can filter bookmarks by tags (include set: show only bookmarks that have at least one of the selected tags)
    - criterion: User can filter bookmarks by domain(s) in URL (hostname)
    - criterion: Display can be sorted by create date, update date, tags, or domain; sort order (asc/desc) is configurable
    - criterion: Display can be grouped by create date, update date, tags, or domain (or none for flat list); grouped sections are collapsible
    - criterion: Selection and display configuration region is expandable for use and collapsible to maximize space for the bookmarks list
    - criterion: Config state (expanded/collapsed, filter values, sort/group choices) is persisted (e.g. chrome.storage.local)
  validation_criteria:
    - method: Manual verification
      coverage: Open panel from popup; select/reorder tags; expand/collapse tag sections; click URL opens in new tab; expand/collapse config; set filters (time, tags, domain), sort and group; verify persistence
    - method: Unit tests
      coverage: buildTagToBookmarks from bookmarks array; tag order; open-URL action with mock chrome.tabs; getDomainFromUrl; filterByTimeRange, filterByTagsInclude, filterByDomains, applyFilters; sortBookmarks; groupBookmarksBy
    - method: Integration tests (mocks)
      coverage: Popup button sends open-panel message; SW calls chrome.sidePanel.open; panel load sends getAggregatedBookmarksForIndex and renders tree
