REQ-UI_INSPECTION:
  name: UI Inspection and Testability
  category: Non-Functional
  priority: P1
  status: Implemented
  rationale:
    why: Enable thorough testing and debugging of extension UI by inspecting inputs, actions, message flow, and outputs
    problems_solved:
      - Difficult to assert on UI actions and message flow in tests
      - No single source of truth for message types and action IDs
      - Hard to inspect stored/displayed state for regression testing
    benefits:
      - Tests can assert on action/message sequence without DOM
      - E2E and unit tests share same contract (message types, action IDs)
      - Debug and dev panel can show last N actions and state
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: UI action contract exports MESSAGE_TYPES and popup/overlay action IDs
      metric: src/shared/ui-action-contract.js
    - criterion: Optional inspector records messages and actions when enabled
      metric: src/shared/ui-inspector.js; gated by DEBUG_HOVERBOARD_UI or setEnabled
    - criterion: Service worker, popup, and content script wire inspector
      metric: recordMessage in SW; recordAction in popup and content script
  validation_criteria:
    - method: Unit tests
      coverage: Contract and inspector API used in tests
    - method: Manual
      coverage: Set DEBUG_HOVERBOARD_UI and verify no-op when unset
