REQ-CODE_QUALITY:
  rationale:
    why: Ensure consistent code style, linting, and build-time quality checks without blocking on unfixable transitive vulnerabilities
    problems_solved:
      - Inconsistent style and undefined globals
      - Build failures due to moderate audit findings in tooling deps
    benefits:
      - Single source of truth for lint rules (ESLint 9 flat config)
      - 'Predictable builds: validate fails only on high/critical'
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: ESLint runs with flat config and Standard preset
      metric: eslint.config.mjs; npm run lint/lint:fix succeed
    - criterion: Node.js version documented
      metric: package.json engines.node >= 18.18.0
    - criterion: Security audit does not block for moderate-only
      metric: security:check uses --audit-level=high
  traceability:
    architecture:
      - ARCH-CODE_QUALITY
    implementation:
      - IMPL-CODE_STYLE
