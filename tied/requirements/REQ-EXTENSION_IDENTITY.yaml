REQ-EXTENSION_IDENTITY:
  name: Extension Identity Preservation
  category: Immutable
  priority: P0
  status: Implemented
  rationale:
    why: Core extension identity is fundamental to user recognition and brand consistency. Changing this would break user expectations and require complete rebranding.
    problems_solved: []
    benefits: []
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: Extension name remains "Hoverboard" in all contexts
    - criterion: Purpose remains Pinboard.in bookmarking interface enhancement
    - criterion: Target platform remains Chrome/Chromium-based browsers
    - criterion: Architecture remains browser extension with content script injection
  validation_criteria:
    - method: Manifest.json name field validation
    - method: Documentation consistency checks
    - method: Branding audit in all user-facing interfaces

  description: The extension must maintain its core identity as "Hoverboard" - a Pinboard.in bookmarking interface enhancement. The name, purpose, and target platform (Chrome/Chromium-based browsers) must never change.
  implementation: See `implementation-decisions.yaml` § [IMPL-EXT_IDENTITY]
  last_updated: '2026-02-13'
  notes: This is an immutable requirement - changes require major version bump and full rebranding.
  tests: Manifest validation tests, branding consistency tests
