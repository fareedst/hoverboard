# [REQ-SIDE_PANEL_BOOKMARK_SEARCH] Side panel bookmark search
# Requirement: In the side panel, user can search the displayed bookmark list by text;
# matching on title, URL, tags, and notes; UI shows count of matching records and offers Next/Previous to advance through matches (scroll and highlight).

REQ-SIDE_PANEL_BOOKMARK_SEARCH:
  name: Side Panel Bookmark Search
  category: Functional
  priority: P1
  status: Implemented
  rationale:
    why: Allow users to quickly locate a specific bookmark in the side panel list without scanning manually.
    problems_solved:
      - Long lists make it hard to find a single bookmark
      - No way to jump to the next/previous match
    benefits:
      - Text search over displayed list (title, URL, tags, notes); match count; Next/Previous with scroll and highlight
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: Search input filters the currently displayed bookmark list by text (match on title, URL, tags, notes)
    - criterion: Match count is displayed (e.g. "N matches" or "No matches")
    - criterion: Next and Previous controls advance to the next/previous matching record with scroll-into-view and highlight
  validation_criteria:
    - method: Unit tests
      coverage: filterBookmarksBySearch: empty query returns all; non-empty matches title/url/tags/extended; case-insensitive; no match returns empty
    - method: Manual verification
      coverage: Type search; see count; use Next/Previous to move through matches; current match highlighted and scrolled into view
