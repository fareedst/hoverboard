REQ-TIED_SETUP:
  name: TIED Methodology Setup
  category: Functional
  priority: P0
  status: Implemented
  rationale:
    why: To ensure traceability of intent from requirements to code and to maintain a consistent development process.

  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: '`tied/` directory exists'
    - criterion: 'All required documentation files exist and are populated from templates:'
    - criterion: '`requirements.md` (index) with `requirements/` directory for detail files'
    - criterion: '`architecture-decisions.md` (index) with `architecture-decisions/` directory for detail files'
    - criterion: '`implementation-decisions.md` (index) with `implementation-decisions/` directory for detail files'
    - criterion: '`semantic-tokens.yaml` (YAML index/database of all tokens - canonical token registry)'
    - criterion: '`semantic-tokens.md` (semantic tokens guide with format and conventions)'
    - criterion: '`processes.md` (process tracking including `[PROC-YAML_DB_OPERATIONS]`)'
    - criterion: '`.cursorrules` contains the TIED rules'
    - criterion: '`AGENTS.md` contains canonical AI agent instructions'
  validation_criteria:
    - method: Manual verification of file existence
    - method: AI agent acknowledgment of principles ("Observing AI principles!")
    - method: Verification that all index files have corresponding detail directories
    - method: Verification that template files are properly structured
