# [REQ-STRUCTURED_LOGGING] Structured logging with context and levels
# Migrated from legacy LOG-001..003 (numbered-token-mapping)
name: Structured Logging
category: Non-Functional
priority: P2
status: Implemented
rationale:
  why: Provide consistent, level-filtered logging with context for debugging and diagnostics
  problems_solved:
    - Ad-hoc console.log and inconsistent log levels
    - No component identification in logs
  benefits:
    - Context-based log attribution; environment-aware level (debug in dev, warn+ in prod)
    - Legacy log() compatibility during migration
satisfaction_criteria:
  - criterion: Logger class with context, getLogLevel, shouldLog, formatMessage, debug/info/warn/error
  - criterion: createLogger(context) factory; legacy log(context, ...args) and noisy flag
validation_criteria:
  - method: Manual/unit
    coverage: Log level filtering and formatting
