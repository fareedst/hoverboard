# To append a new requirement:
# 1. Copy the template block at the bottom of this file (REQ-IDENTIFIER)
# 2. Paste it at the end with a blank line before it
# 3. Replace REQ-IDENTIFIER with your new token
# 4. Fill in all fields
# 5. Update the detail_file path to match your new .md file in requirements/ directory
#
# Field descriptions:
#   name: Short descriptive name of the requirement
#   category: Functional | Non-Functional | Immutable
#   priority: P0 (Critical) | P1 (Important) | P2 (Nice-to-have) | P3 (Future)
