    problems_solved:
      - No way to store bookmarks in a folder that can be cloud-synchronized
      - Users cannot share bookmark files with ad-hoc groups
    benefits:
      - Single directory, single file format (e.g. hoverboard-bookmarks.json) suitable for cloud sync
      - Same bookmark shape as local/Pinboard; file format versioned for future compatibility
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: File-based provider implements same contract as LocalBookmarkService/PinboardService

  category: Functional

  rationale:
    why: Each bookmark is tagged with a storage method (pinboard | local | file); routing by URL enables move and default for new bookmarks
    problems_solved:
      - Single global storage mode prevents mixing backends
      - No way to move a bookmark from one storage to another
    benefits:
      - Storage index maps URL -> backend; default backend for new bookmarks from config
      - Router delegates get/save/delete to correct provider per URL
      - Enables move UI (copy to target, delete from source, update index)
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: 'Storage index in chrome.storage.local (hoverboard_storage_index): url -> pinboard|local|file|sync'

    problems_solved:
      - No way to change where a bookmark is stored after saving
    benefits:
      - UI shows current storage and allows moving to another backend
      - Move = copy to target + delete from source + update index
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: Popup shows current bookmark storage (Pinboard | Local | File) and control to move

REQ-URL_TAGS_DISPLAY:
  name: URL Tags and Badge Single Source
  category: Functional
  priority: P1
  status: Implemented
  rationale:
    why: Badge and popup must show the same tag count and tag list for a URL; a single logical source prevents popup showing no tags or losing prior tags on add
    problems_solved:
      - Popup shows no current tags when badge shows correct count
      - Adding a tag overwrites existing tags when popup state was stale
      - Inconsistent tags shape (string vs array) across providers
      - Popup empty when no Pinboard auth even though bookmark exists in local/file/sync
    benefits:
      - Single module normalizes bookmark/tags for display; badge and popup use same contract
      - Tags for a URL always normalized to array; badge value (count, flags) from same source
      - Popup re-fetches and merges when adding/removing tags so prior tags are never lost
      - getCurrentBookmark always from router (no short-circuit when no Pinboard auth); popup shows tags from local/file/sync
      - getTagsForUrl message centralizes tag storage for tests and UI
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: Badge shows the same tag count and flags as popup/overlay for the same URL
    - criterion: List of tags for a URL provided by a single logical source (normalized to array) for all consumers
    - criterion: Message handler returns normalized bookmark (tags array) for getCurrentBookmark; never short-circuits on no Pinboard auth so router (local/file/sync) data is returned
    - criterion: Popup treats needsAuth as bookmark present and displays returned tags; only treats as no bookmark when blocked
    - criterion: Popup re-fetches current tags from backend before add/remove tag and merges
    - criterion: getTagsForUrl message returns tags array for URL from same source (router + url-tags-manager) to facilitate tests

    problems_solved:

      - Build failures due to moderate audit findings in tooling dependencies (e.g. ESLint compat stack)
    benefits:
      - Single source of truth for lint rules (ESLint 9 flat config)

REQ-BOOKMARK_CREATE_UPDATE_TIMES:
  name: Bookmark Create-Time and Most-Recent-Update-Time
  category: Functional
  priority: P1
  status: Implemented
  rationale:
    why: Each bookmark must have an explicit create-time and most-recent-update-time for auditing, sorting, and display.
    problems_solved:
      - Single "time" field ambiguous between created vs updated
      - No way to know when a bookmark was last modified
    benefits:
      - Clear semantics: create-time never changes; updated_at changes on every save
      - Pinboard has only create-time; most-recent-update-time equals create-time for Pinboard
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: Every bookmark has create-time (existing `time` field) and most-recent-update-time (`updated_at`).
    - criterion: For new records, most-recent-update-time equals create-time.
    - criterion: For local/file/sync, on update create-time is preserved and most-recent-update-time is set to now.
    - criterion: For Pinboard, only create-time exists; most-recent-update-time is always equal to the stored create-time.
  validation_criteria:
    - method: Unit tests for services (new/update/legacy normalization)
    - method: Unit tests for Pinboard parse and createEmptyBookmark
    - method: Unit tests for export/import with updated_at

      reason: Initial creation for bookmark create/update times
  summary: Each bookmark tracks create-time (`time`) and most-recent-update-time (`updated_at`). New records set both equal; local/file/sync set `updated_at` to now on save; Pinboard only has create-time so `updated_at` equals `time`.
