ARCH-UI_TESTABILITY:
  rationale:
    why: Single source of truth for message types and action IDs; optional inspector for testing and debugging
    problems_solved:
      - Tests and E2E cannot reliably assert on message flow and UI actions
      - No shared contract between popup, content script, and service worker for inspection
    benefits:
      - Inspector records messages and actions when enabled (gated by flag)
      - Contract module used by tests and inspector
  implementation_approach:
    summary: ui-action-contract.js re-exports MESSAGE_TYPES and defines POPUP_ACTION_IDS/OVERLAY_ACTION_IDS; ui-inspector.js provides ring buffers and is wired in SW, popup, content; Playwright extension E2E (IMPL-PLAYWRIGHT_E2E_EXTENSION) covers popup, messaging, evaluation contexts, overlay, options, side panel.
    details:
      - Service worker records each message after handleMessage; popup/content recordAction at start of handlers
      - Inspector enabled via localStorage DEBUG_HOVERBOARD_UI or setEnabled in SW (from chrome.storage.local)
      - E2E specs: extension-popup.spec.js, extension-messaging.spec.js, extension-evaluation.spec.js, extension-lower.spec.js (run: npm run test:e2e:extension)
  traceability:
    requirements:
      - REQ-UI_INSPECTION
    implementation:
      - IMPL-UI_ACTION_CONTRACT
      - IMPL-UI_INSPECTOR
      - IMPL-PLAYWRIGHT_E2E_EXTENSION
