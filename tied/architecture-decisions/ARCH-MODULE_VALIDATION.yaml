    - REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION
  rationale:
    why: |-
      Eliminates bugs related to code complexity by ensuring each module works correctly in isolation
      Reduces integration complexity by validating modules independently before combining them
      Catches bugs early in the development cycle, before integration issues compound
      Ensures each module meets its defined contract before integration
      Makes debugging easier by isolating issues to specific modules
      Enables parallel development of modules when dependencies are properly mocked

    summary: Independent module validation before integration to eliminate complexity-related bugs.
    details:
      - |-
        Modules must be identified and documented before development begins
        Each module must have clear boundaries and responsibilities
        Module interfaces and contracts must be defined and documented
        Module dependencies must be identified and documented
        Module validation criteria must be specified (what "validated" means for each module)
      - |-
        Integration tasks must be separate from module development and validation tasks
        Integration only occurs after module validation passes
        Integration tests validate the combined behavior of validated modules
        Module validation results must be documented before integration
